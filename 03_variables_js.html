        // 1. Declaring Variables in JavaScript

        // 1.1 var (Function-scoped or Globally scoped)

            // var was the original way to declare variables in JavaScript, but it has some issues with scoping that have led to the introduction of let and const.
            // Variables declared with var are function-scoped (if inside a function) or globally scoped (if declared outside a function).
            // They are also hoisted, meaning the declaration is moved to the top of its scope.


        // 1.2 let (Block-scoped)

            // let was introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) and provides block-scoping.
            //     This means that the variable is only accessible within the block (enclosed by {}) where it is defined.
            //     Variables declared with let are not hoisted like var and are safer to use in modern JavaScript.

        // 1.3 const (Block-scoped, but read-only)

            // const is similar to let in terms of block scoping, but it is used for variables that should not be reassigned after their initial assignment.
            // It creates a constant reference to a value.
            // While the reference to the variable cannot be changed, the content of the variable (if it's an object or array) can still be modified.

        //++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

        // var x = 5;
        // var = variable declaration(Not variable type)
        // x = variable name;
        // 100 = variable value;

        // Javascript wl variable declaration wlt use krnn puluwn ay 3i.
        //    1) var x = 5;
        //    2) let a = 5;
        //    3) const a = 5;

        // variable declaration types
        //     1) Non-block scope variable types
                    // Able to access anywhere in the file.Don't care about block scope.
                    // ex = var
        //      2) block scope variable types
                    //Access only limited to block-scope
                    //ex = const,let

        // var x = 10;
        // var y = "Hello";

        // var age = 28; Legal

        // var _age = 28; Legal // Variable ekk private variable ekk kiyl adhs krnn developers la Variable ek issrht _ dn standard ekk hdgthth.
        // Javascript mek private krnne nh.Ek dnne developerslt dngnn. Foreign companies wl me standard ek godk follow krnw.

        // var $age = 28; Legal
        // var 4age = 28; Illegal(Cannot start with a number)

        // var hello = 1;
        // var Hello = 2; These are 2 variables.But we don't start a variable with capital letters.

        // In JavaScript, variables are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated throughout the program.
        // You can declare variables using different keywords, and each type of declaration has its own scope and behavior.
